# ADHD Classifier üß†

A reproducible machine-learning pipeline for predicting children at risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using the publicly available National Survey of Children‚Äôs Health (NSCH) dataset.

---

## 1  Overview

Early identification of ADHD can improve access to timely interventions.  
This project trains several baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and an optimized Random Forest classifier that:

* Ingests raw NSCH survey files (‚âà 100 k respondents)  
* Performs automated cleaning, encoding, and feature-engineering  
* Evaluates models with cross-validated metrics and class-imbalance handling  
* Outputs an interpretable report of feature importances and performance scores

The code is modular, so you can swap models or preprocessing steps with minimal changes.
